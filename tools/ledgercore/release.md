# Release process

This document describes how to build, validate, and publish a `ledgercore`
release.

## Prerequisites

Install build and validation tools:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev,docs,release]"
# or, equivalently:
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]" && python -m pip install build twine
```

`ledgercore` uses hatch-vcs for versioning. Installing or building the project
generates a gitignored `ledgercore/_version.py` that exposes
`ledgercore.__version__`; do not commit that file.
Direct source-tree imports fall back to `0.0.0+unknown` when that generated
module is absent.

## Pre-release checklist

1. Ensure all tests pass:

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

2. Ensure lint is clean:

```bash
python -m ruff check .
```

3. Ensure type checking passes:

```bash
python -m mypy ledgercore
```

4. Ensure formatting and documentation are clean:

```bash
python -m ruff format --check .
python -m sphinx -W -b html docs docs/_build/html
```

5. Ensure a `LICENSE` file is present and ships in the built artifacts:

```bash
test -f LICENSE
```

6. Ensure examples run from the source tree with `PYTHONPATH=. python examples/*.py`
   (or after installing the package).

## Building

```bash
python -m build
```

Builds from a non-git source archive are supported when the intended version is
provided explicitly:

```bash
SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION=0.2.0 python -m build
```

This produces `dist/ledgercore-<version>.tar.gz` and
`dist/ledgercore-<version>-py3-none-any.whl`.

## Validating the distribution

```bash
python -m twine check dist/*
```

## Smoke testing (required release gate)

Install the built wheel into a clean virtualenv and run the smoke test. Use a
writable location for the venv (on some platforms `/tmp` is not writable):

```bash
smoke_dir="$(pwd)/.smoke"
rm -rf "$smoke_dir"
python -m venv "$smoke_dir"
"$smoke_dir/bin/python" -m pip install "$(echo dist/*.whl)"
"$smoke_dir/bin/python" - <<'PY'
from pathlib import Path
import tempfile
from ledgercore import __version__
from ledgercore.ids import LedgerIdFormat
from ledgercore.refs import parse_resource_ref
from ledgercore.frontmatter import render_front_matter_text, split_front_matter_text
from ledgercore.jsonl import load_jsonl_object_map, write_jsonl_objects
from ledgercore.time import utc_now_iso

assert isinstance(__version__, str) and __version__
assert LedgerIdFormat(prefix="task").format(1) == "task-0001"
assert parse_resource_ref("tl:task-0001").global_ref == "tl:task-0001"
text = render_front_matter_text({"id": "task-0001", "flag": "no"}, "# Body\n", scalar_style="minimal")
meta, body = split_front_matter_text(text)
assert meta["id"] == "task-0001" and meta["flag"] == "no" and body == "# Body\n"
with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as d:
    path = Path(d) / "rows.jsonl"
    write_jsonl_objects(path, [{"id": "a", "v": 1}, {"id": "b", "v": 2}])
    result = load_jsonl_object_map(path, key="id")
    assert not result.issues and set(result.rows_by_key) == {"a", "b"}
assert utc_now_iso().endswith("Z")
print("ledgercore smoke test passed")
PY
rm -rf "$smoke_dir"
```

Also verify the built artifacts ship the `LICENSE` file and the generated
`ledgercore/_version.py`:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
import glob, tarfile, zipfile
wheel = glob.glob("dist/*.whl")[0]
sdist = glob.glob("dist/*.tar.gz")[0]
with zipfile.ZipFile(wheel) as z:
    names = z.namelist()
    assert any(name.endswith("LICENSE") for name in names)
    assert "ledgercore/_version.py" in names
with tarfile.open(sdist) as t:
    names = t.getnames()
    assert any(name.endswith("/LICENSE") for name in names)
    assert any(name.endswith("/ledgercore/_version.py") for name in names)
print("artifact check passed")
PY
```

## Publishing

```bash
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

## Version policy

`ledgercore` is pre-1.0. Public APIs are intended to be stable within the
0.2.x series, but breaking changes may still happen before 1.0.0 when needed
to keep the core API small and consistent.
