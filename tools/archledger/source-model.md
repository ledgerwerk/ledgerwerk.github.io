# Source model

## Canonical source

The source of truth is the fragment tree under `archledger_dir`:

- `sections/` for the major arc42 chapter skeleton
- `records/` for individual architecture facts
- `archive/` for archived records and tombstones that preserve allocated ledger IDs

Records include structural, behavioral, and decision artifacts plus first-class
`diagram` records. Diagram records default to plain text diagrams (`diagram_type = "text"`).
Text diagrams stay embedded in Markdown/AsciiDoc record bodies as readable fenced blocks.
Mermaid is available for compact sequence, state, or flow diagrams but is not the default.

Fragments contain YAML front matter and a body in the configured dialect.
Archived fragments keep normal front matter and use `status: archived`.
Archledger does not store creation, update, or archive timestamps in ledger
source. Every current source fragment has a positive monotonic `version`.
CLI mutation commands increment it exactly once; manual source edits must
increment it manually.

## Ledger ID format

Default IDs use `<prefix>_<number>` (for example `al_0013`).

When `[ids].segment_mode = "type"`, IDs use
`<prefix>_<segment>_<number>` (for example `al_content_0013` and
`al_risk_0014`). Segment values come from metadata/config mapping, while
the numeric sequence remains one global ledger-wide counter.

## Traceability

Use `source_refs` when fragments describe real files or directories.
Directory refs must end with `/` and must exist in the workspace.

## Generated output

Generated build outputs are derived artifacts and should not be edited as
source. New projects default to `build/` under the workspace root, and
`[build].default_output_dir` may place outputs elsewhere.

## External references

Use generic `links` and `source_refs` for artifacts outside the architecture
ledger. Archledger preserves these references as data and does not interpret
external domain semantics.

Example:

```yaml
links:
  - rel: documents
    target_kind: path
    target: specs/behavior/features/task-management/plan-gates.feature
    reason: External artifact documents the runtime flow.
```
