# releaseledger storage and configuration

## Default layout

A normal project stores release state inside the workspace:

```toml
config_version = 1
releaseledger_dir = ".releaseledger"

ledger_ref = "main"
ledger_parent_ref = ""
ledger_next_entry_number = 1
ledger_branch_guard = "off"

[ledger]
code = "rl"
name = "releaseledger"

[release]
default_changelog = "CHANGELOG.md"
default_status = "planned"
allow_dirty_worktree = true
```

Storage tree:

```text
.releaseledger/
  ledgers/
    main/
      releases/
        <version>/
          release.md
          entries/
            entry-0001.md
      events/
        events.jsonl
      indexes/
        releases.json
        entries.json
```

Release and entry records are Markdown files with YAML front matter. Mutation dates are not stored; git history provides chronology. Indexes are derived and expose record revisions for inspection.

## External state directories

Projects that keep generated state in a sibling repository can opt into an external path:

```toml
releaseledger_dir = "../ledger/release/releaseledger"
releaseledger_dir_policy = "external"
```

CLI form:

```bash
releaseledger init   --releaseledger-dir ../ledger/release/releaseledger   --external-dir

releaseledger config set releaseledger_dir   ../ledger/release/releaseledger   --external-dir
```

Relative paths that escape the workspace are rejected unless the external policy is explicit.

## Diagnostics

Inspect effective paths and layout health without mutation:

```bash
releaseledger storage where
releaseledger --json storage where
releaseledger config show
releaseledger --json config show
```
